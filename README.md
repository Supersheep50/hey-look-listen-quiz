# hey-look-listen-quiz

The Hey! Look! Listen! Quiz is a mutiple choice quiz game that is based off of the popular video game podcast. Users are asked 20 random video game questions and are given 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible. 

The questions vary in difficult but the most important thing is to have fun! Some questions include inside jokes for fans of the podcast.

### Features Left to Implement

- I had hoped to integrate a way for people to also listen to the podcast while playing th quiz but ultimately ran out of time before I could make that happen. 

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Fixed Bugs 

- Quiz was not recoginizing the correct answer. My styling on my answers was causing right answers to be seen as wrong answers.
- Timer was not counting down from 60 and acting erratically when starting a new game. 
- Background photo and Logo not showing up on live page.
- Play Again button would only work when all 20 questions had been answered.
- Score counter didnt stop at 20


### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository]
At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
Click the the "Pages" link on the left-hand side of the screen.
Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Main Branch".
The page will automatically refresh.
Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "Pages" section.
